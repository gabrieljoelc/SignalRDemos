SignalRDemos
============

This is a SignalR (http://signalr.net/) sandbox project. It includes NServiceBus (http://www.nservicebus.com/) integration both using it's container to for all of the dependency resolvers (e.g. MVC, Web API, and SignalR) and to demonstrate the use of a SignalR hub proxy in a NServiceBus handler to call the client (see https://github.com/SignalR/SignalR/wiki/SignalR-Client-Hubs).

FYI, the NServiceBus example doesn't work on my website of the sample.
